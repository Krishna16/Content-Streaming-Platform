# Content-Streaming-Platform

Streaming content has become the norm in 2020 after the lockdown forced the world indoors. As the name implies, this project is a full-fledged streaming platform made using Java, XML & Firebase as the backend.

Users can create their account and select the genres they are the most interested in. The platform will then recommend content (which includes TV shows as well as Movies) according to the genres selected. For now, the platform only supports streaming TV shows and provides extensive information on various movies (such as their ratings, genre & descriptions).

Users have the flexibility to edit their choice of genres (as well as other information submitted during account creation) and will be served new content if any changes are made to the genre.
